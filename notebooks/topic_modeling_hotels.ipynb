Great location close to yummy night dining (although I do not reccomend the Tex Mex restaraunt down the street).

       "[\"We stayed three nights over Thanksgiving weekend. While it's a ways out of downtown London, the little town it's in is great--lots of delicious restaurants, inexpensive shopping, close to a fairly major highway. Our two rooms were spare but comfortable and very clean. Bathrooms were fine. Mattresses were sad, saggy and lumpy, but at least not rock hard and the sheets fit and stayed on well. The comforter was just the perfect weight for the weather--we all slept well. There's an in-house restaurant with room service, which we never had a chance to use. The a la carte prices were reasonable, except the buffet breakfast, which was high. It's difficult to find the parking lots, but once you figure out the one way streets and round-abouts, there is safe, adequate parking. We'd go back. For only nine pounds a night for two people, it's a great bargain!\",\n",
       " \"very uncomfortable stay We were staying at his hotel only because my father couldnt make it and rather than cancel the rooms we took his place and visited some family, however on arriving to check in at about 10.30pm we were to be told that we were put in on the system as a 'No Show'!! So the night porter then started to look for another room for us, he found us a room on the top floor and went off to the back office to get the key cards, on his return we was told he didnt have any key cards to hand and would have to 'run up and down the hotel to find some' by this point there was also 3 other parties waiting to check in who also had no key cards available, so off he went 5 mins later he returned with key cards, I will add though that he was very apologetic and this was an unfortunate case for him as he was the only guy on the desk and he was still working on the desk as we were checking out at 10.30am!!On approaching the room we could smell cigarette smoke along the corridor, once we got into our room the light bulb was missing from the entrance light, a bedside table had been ripped off the wall, a bulb had been snapped off and broken in the bedside light and the light shade was ripped, there was dirty smeared finger marks on the ceiling in the bedroom and on the ceiling above the shower, we only had 1 bath towel between us, there was no phone to contact reception and being on the top floor in room 703 I think you need that and to top it all off the bed was the worst we have slept in for a long time, the pair of us woke up with severe back &amp; muscular pain. We just grabbed a quick shower and left ASAP!!!\",\n",
       " 'Cheap and Cheerless Can 10,000 White Van men be wrong? The rooms are large (enough for four workmen to share), the bathrooms clean(ish) and the lifts work - most of the time. This is not a business hotel. If your company puts you here, you are either very junior or unloved.Most of the staff try very hard, but it is obvious that this hotel needs to be refurbished as the beds are saggy (4 workmen again) the sofas worn and the carpets and walls damaged.It is, however, cheap - if you book and get a sale price. The lowest I paid was £19 mid week.Tolworth has little to offer except a brilliant Italian restaurant (Sorrento), a good fish and chip restaurant and a fast route to the A3!']"

For only nine pounds a night for two people, it's a great bargain!  \n",
       "1      We stayed three nights over Thanksgiving weekend. While it's a ways out of downtown London, the little town it's in is great--lots of delicious restaurants, inexpensive shopping, close to a fairly major highway. Our two rooms were spare but comfortable and very clean. Bathrooms were fine. Mattresses were sad, saggy and lumpy, but at least not rock hard and the sheets fit and stayed on well. The comforter was just the perfect weight for the weather--we all slept well. There's an in-house restaurant with room service, which we never had a chance to use. The a la carte prices were reasonable, except the buffet breakfast, which was high. It's difficult to find the parking lots, but once you figure out the one way streets and round-abouts, there is safe, adequate parking. We'd go back.
